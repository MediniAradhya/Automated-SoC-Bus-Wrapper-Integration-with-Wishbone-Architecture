# Automated-SoC-Bus-Wrapper-Integration-with-Wishbone-Architecture
Developed a framework to automatically augment miscellaneous IPs i.e. crypto engines and DSP blocks with wishbone compatible wrappers. 
Successfully automated the generation of bus wrapper for both the IPs available as part of the SoCCom tool.
Demonstrated wishbone compatible IP functionality via functional simulation using 'Verilator' (Simulator) and observed output waveforms using 'GTK wave' Viewer.
